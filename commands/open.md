description: Open the Cuelight dashboard for this session's subagents
argument-hint: "[stop | report [path]]"
---

Run Cuelight for the current Claude Code session.

Each action is one `cuelight` command. Claude Code puts the plugin's `bin/`
directory on the Bash tool's PATH, so `cuelight` runs as a bare command. Run it
exactly as written, with the Bash tool, from the current directory: no `cd`, no
extra flags and no shell variables. Cuelight finds the session and the project by
itself.

Dispatch on `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **empty** — start the dashboard and print its URL:
  ```bash
  cuelight
  ```
- **`stop`** — shut the server down:
  ```bash
  cuelight --stop
  ```
- **`report`** or **`report <path>`** — write a self-contained HTML snapshot:
  ```bash
  cuelight --report "<path or .>"
  ```

If the shell says `cuelight` is not found (an older Claude Code), run the same
action as `python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/orchestra/__main__.py"` followed by the
same flags, using `python3` if `python` is not found.

Report back to the user exactly what the command printed — the URL, the report
path, or the failure text. Do not paraphrase a failure as success, and do not
retry a failed start more than once.

If the command prints "no session id", tell the user Cuelight could not detect
the session and they can pass one explicitly with `--session`.
