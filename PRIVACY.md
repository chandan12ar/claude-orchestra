# Privacy policy

Cuelight is a Claude Code plugin that runs **entirely on your computer**. This page says exactly what
it reads, what it writes, and what leaves your machine (nothing).

*Last updated: 2026-10-03, for version 0.4.1.*

## Short version

- **Nothing is sent anywhere.** Cuelight makes no outside network connections, has no analytics or
  telemetry, and has no account or sign-in. The author does not receive any data from your use of it.
- **It only watches.** It reads files Claude Code already writes and cannot approve, deny or change anything.
- **Secrets are redacted** before anything is shown in the dashboard.

## What it reads

| What | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code session transcripts | `~/.claude/projects/...` | To rebuild the run: which agents ran, what each was asked, what each produced, and what the session is called and Claude Code's last recap of it |
| Hook events written by its own hooks | `<state dir>/events/<session>.jsonl` | To know when a session is waiting for your permission or input |
| An optional price file you supply | the path in `ORCHESTRA_PRICES`, else Cuelight's per-user config folder | To show an estimated cost. It is never fetched from the internet |

Transcripts can contain anything you and Claude discussed, including personal or confidential text.
Cuelight reads them **locally** and shows them to **you** in a browser tab on the same computer. It does
not copy them anywhere else.

## What it writes

| What | Where | Kept for |
|---|---|---|
| One line per hook event: the event name, session and agent ids, working directory and a short **redacted** message. Never tool inputs, prompts or file contents | `<state dir>/events/` | 7 days, then deleted |
| The dashboard's port and access token | `<state dir>` (mode `0600`) | Until the dashboard stops |
| Optional run history (**off by default**; you turn it on with `ORCHESTRA_HISTORY=on`). **Metrics only**: counts, durations, tokens, cost and the project folder, with no prompts, task text, results or file paths | a small local SQLite file in Cuelight's per-user data folder | 90 days (adjustable), then pruned |
| A static HTML report, **only when you ask** (`/cuelight:open report`) | the path you choose | Until you delete it |

`<state dir>` is `ORCHESTRA_STATE_DIR` if set, otherwise a per-user folder (mode `0700`) in the system temp
directory. Cuelight **never writes under `~/.claude`**.

You can turn hook recording off completely by setting `ORCHESTRA_EVENTS=off` in the environment Claude Code
runs in. The dashboard then works from transcripts alone.

## What leaves your computer

**Nothing.** The dashboard server listens on `127.0.0.1` only (not reachable from other devices), requires a
random access token, and checks the `Host` and `Origin` of every request. The page loads no fonts, scripts or
images from the internet, and an automated test fails the build if any external reference is added.

Using Claude Code itself sends your prompts to Anthropic as it always does. That traffic belongs to Claude Code
and is governed by Anthropic's terms and privacy policy; Cuelight does not add to it or change it.
